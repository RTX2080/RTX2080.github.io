Hi, I am Xuyang Ma, currently a second-year PhD student at Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), under supervision of Prof. [Peng Song](https://songpenghit.github.io/), my research lies in the field of Computational Design, specifically some puzzle problems.

Previously, I earned my master degree from Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), supervised by Prof. [Yiqing Zhou](https://www.ict.ac.cn/sourcedb/cn/jssrck/200909/t20090917_2496807.html), where I worked on Satellite Communtitaion.

Before master studies, I reveived my bachelor degree from School of Software Engineering at Shandong University, where I spent more than one thousand hours on Competitive Programming Contests, see [SDU News](https://www.view.sdu.edu.cn/info/1022/119097.htm).
